# Gallery App

This is a simple Gallery Application to display images with labels.

### With this application I have learnt various concepts, such as:

- Implementing Dialogs & Actions Menu
- Fetching image from internet
- Fetching labels and palette for image using ML model
- Dynamic Views
- Asynchronous Task
- Custom callback/listeners
- Ripple Click effect
- Get Redirected URL
- Use of JSON
- Shared Preferences

### Have a run at it with the APK [here](https://github.com/shrutiisharma/GalleryApp/releases/download/version1/app-debug.apk)!
